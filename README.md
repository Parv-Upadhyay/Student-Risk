# Student-Risk
This project predicts whether a student is at risk of failing or dropping out. It uses a machine learning model trained on data like attendance, grades, study hours, and assignments. A simple web app built with Streamlit lets users enter this data and see the prediction instantly. It's useful for identifying students who may need extra help.
